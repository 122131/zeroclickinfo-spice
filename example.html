This is a stub function that takes what you pass it 
and creates the Zero-click Info that gets shoved
into the body of the page in the div marked "a".

function nra(items) {

<!-- 
We call the external script here.
All excternal calls go through our server for security and privacy, e.g.
we strip referer headers so search terms don't leak and we can hide api keys.

We can also change the response so it goes into JSONP format,
which means it calls your function directly.

If the provider already has JSONP you can use it for testing directly.

The /ir/ piece will change for each endpoint, e.g. /ib/ for bitcoin.
